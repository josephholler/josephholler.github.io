## Bio

I am a human geographer and geographic information scientist with interest in open science and the reproducibility of geographic research, and in applying geographic research to global challenges of climate change, hazards, social vulnerability, and social inequality and justice.
I routinely teach courses on introductory geographic information systems, human geography of hazards, advanced open geographic information science, and climate change adaptation and development, but I have also taught  place and society, water rights and resources, political ecology, and urban geography.

I earned my bachelor's degree in anthropology/archeology, computer science, and media studies at [Ithaca College](https://www.ithaca.edu/).
After graduating, I taught math and information technology in Tanzanian secondary schools as a [Peace Corps](https://www.peacecorps.gov/) volunteer---first in the outskirts of Mwanza and then in Bukoba.
I discovered geography through Ihungo Secondary School's advanced-level combination of history-geography-economics (HGE), and through an agricultural extension officer tracking locusts with global positioning systems.
Then on a weekend mountain bike trip to visit an information technology NGO in Kayanga, I did some research on graduate programs in geographic information systems (GIS) using their satellite internet connection.
Thank you, Joseph Sekiku and [FADECO](https://www.fadeco.co.tz/)!

When I returned to the United States, I enrolled in a Geography PhD and Geographic Information Science (GISCience) IGERT (Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship) NSF Fellowship at the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA) at the [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/geography.html).
I returned to Tanzania to work with the [Jane Goodall Institute](https://janegoodall.org/) in Dar es Salaam and Moshi in preparation for dissertation research on climate change vulnerability and adaptation on Mount Kilimanjaro.

Just as I was finishing my dissertation in 2012, the [University of Mary Washington](https://cas.umw.edu/geography/) needed a one year leave replacement to teach human geography and GIS.
The next year, I joined the [Middlebury College Department of Geography](https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/geography) as a GIS Teaching Fellow.
I am now an assistant professor at Middlebury, teaching courses on hazards, GIS, Open GIScience, and climate adaptation and development.
